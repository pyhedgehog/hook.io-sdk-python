### Roadmap
 - 0.0.* - implement hook.io-sdk replacement + (debug) additions (like `account.login`) + CLI + tests + examples
 - 0.1.* - implement `Hook` replacement (python-style layer) + compilehook
 - 0.2.* - python-style layer on client
 - 0.* - attempt to implement all [plans](#Current plans)
 - 0.9.* - documentation (at least auto-documentation) must be ready before 1.0

    - Can be implemented by:
      - listing keys (needs `keys::read`)
      - creating temporary hook (needs `hook::create` and `hook::destroy`)
      - creating temporary file (`readdir` shows owner) (needs `files::writeFile`, `files::readdir` and `files::removeFile`)
      - Using `Hook` variable if we are inside hook.io server
  - [ ] signup
  - [x] login (user/password session instead of API key)

### Points in question

 - In original SDK [TO-DO section](https://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io-sdk#todo) there are "Better ENV exports configuration" entry. Maybe "support" or "import"?
 - In original SDK [TO-DO section](https://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io-sdk#todo) there are "Add all hook.io API Methods" entry. Where one can get list of _all_ methods?

### Current plans

- [ ] Test automation
  - [ ] Misc tests
    - [x] List `hookio.keys.roles` up to date with https://hook.io/roles
    - [x] Test server-side operation
    - [ ] Import https://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io-test/tree/master/tests/client

  - [ ] Setup test CI
    - [x] travis
    - [ ] appveyor
- [x] Auto-test available changes in hook.io-sdk since last sync (helpers/jssdksyncmon.py)
- [ ] Auto-generate docs
- [ ] CLI improvements:
  - [ ] Hook download with creation repository `package.json` and so on
  - [ ] Hook creation from `hooks` repository `package.json`
    - [ ] Add `hookio` package bundle to top of hook source (`helpers/compilehook.py`)
    - [ ] Add package bundle to account files and some loader to top of hook source
    - [ ] Rely on availability of `hookio` package on server (sometime it will happens)
  - [ ] Hook running via `gateway-*`s (https://hook.io/gateways)
  - [ ] Parse `logging.LogRecord` dict-style entries in `hookio logs` subcommands
  - [ ] Mass operations (i.e. mass `hookio hook destroy`)
  - [ ] Pseudo-FS (fuse, pyfilesystems, ...):
    - Access to vfs (sdk.files)
    - hooks (with resources and logs)
    - datastore maybe
- [ ] Server-side operations (use sdk inside hook):
  - [ ] Hook `logging` to write `hookio.logs.write` (maybe as a separate code in run-hook-python - see bigcompany/hook.io#236)
  - [ ] All `payload` mentioned in https://github.com/bigcompany/hook.io/blob/master/bin/run-hook
    - [ ] addTrailers
    - [ ] removeHeader
    - [ ] setHeader
    - [ ] setTimeout
    - [ ] sendDate
    - [ ] statusMessage
    - [ ] statusCode
    - [ ] writeContinue
    - [ ] writeHead
    - [ ] error
    - [ ] log
  - [ ] Implement WSGI
    - https://github.com/bninja/wsgim-rip
- [ ] Rethink support for async operations (depends on async support for requests)
- [ ] Second-layer over API with more python-friendly interfaces:
  - [ ] Interface to fork a thread/threads to join `sdk.logs.stream` to `logging`
    - [ ] Converter to make `logging.LogRecord` from parsed log `dict`
    - [ ] async access for `logs.stream` with ability to add joined streams (depends on async feature)
  - [ ] Wrapper interface to `sdk.files` API (`Hook.os` maybe?)
  - [ ] `__call__` interface to `sdk.hook.run`(`hookio.any.<owner>.<name>()` for anonymous calls?)
  - [ ] `sdk.environ`: Cache?

### Decisions

 - `def createClient` has js-like interface (gets dict as only argument - you can pass config to it).
 - `def createClient` reads environment variables for absent parameters (i.e. `$hookAccessKey`).
 - `class Client` has some sane defaults, but don't reads any config.
 - CLI argument parsing is separated from library API. I.e. `argparse` specifics should be kept in `runclient.py`.
 - `helpers/compilehook.py` can concat library with hook that uses it.

## Documentation

### Documentation Status

There are no documentation yet - it's just several lists (plans, implemented parts, decisions).
If someone want to add important documentation parts here - help will be appreciated.
Also you are free to play in project wiki.

### Handout

 * You must create `Client` instance by `Client()` or `createClient()` call.
 * If you are on server side (i.e. inside hook) you can create if using `install_hook_sdk()`.
   This will also attempt to replace `__main__.Hook` variable with `hookio.utils.Namespace` instance
   with additional field interface and `__main__.Hook.sdk` field referring `Client` instance.
 * `Client` instance has lazy-import fields associated with modules - methods of these fields are public API.

#### Revised API

 * Most of `Client` public API corresponds to call to one URL. Such methods has `raw` parameter.
   Default value of this parameter defers by methods - usually `False`, but can be `True` (i.e. for streaming methods).
   If `raw=True` method will return `requests.Response` instance.
   If `raw=False` method will return some object representation - usually result of JSON parse.
   Exception is streaming interface.
 * Some methods of public API supports streaming interface.
   You can pass callable object as `streaming` parameter and it will be called for each line or object (depending on `raw`).
   You can pass `streaming=True` and use `iter_lines()` or `iter_content()` methods of `requests.Response` instance.
   Precise meaning of combinations of `streaming`, `raw` and other parameters may differ for each methods - look documentation and source.
